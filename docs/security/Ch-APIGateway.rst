API Gateway
###################

The EdgeX API gateway serves as the entry point for all of EdgeX REST requests. With API gateway in place, all REST traffic to an EdgeX micro service is verified and authenticated. The API gateway provides user account creation and management as well. 
The API gateway is implemented with KONG, a 3rd party open source reverse proxy implementation.
